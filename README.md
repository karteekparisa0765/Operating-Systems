this repository contains practical implementations of various experiments and concepts related to Operating Systems. It serves as a personal archive where I store all the complex code that I have written during my practice and learning. The primary purpose of this repository is to act as a backup for my work, ensuring that I can easily access my implementations whenever needed.

The repository includes code for key operating system concepts such as:

Process Scheduling (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, etc.)
Memory Management (Paging, Segmentation, Virtual Memory)
File Systems (File Allocation Methods, Disk Scheduling)
Interprocess Communication (IPC) (Pipes, Message Queues, Shared Memory)
Synchronization Mechanisms (Semaphores, Mutex, Deadlock Handling)
System Calls and other low-level OS functionalities
This collection not only serves as a reference for future projects but also helps in revisiting and reinforcing my understanding of core OS principles.
